  "description": "Given a doubly linked list where nodes have an additional child pointer that may point to another doubly linked list, flatten all levels into a single-level doubly linked list. The child list should be inserted after the current node and before the current node's next. After flattening, all child pointers should be null.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]",
      "output": "[1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]",
      "explanation": "Node 3 has a child list starting at 7. Node 8 has a child list starting at 11. Flatten recursively by DFS/iteration."
    },
    {
      "input": "head = [1,2,null,3]",
      "output": "[1,3,2]",
      "explanation": "Node 1 has a child pointer to 3. Insert child list after node 1."
