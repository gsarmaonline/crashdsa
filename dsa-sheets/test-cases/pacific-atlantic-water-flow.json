From (0,1): (1,1)=3>2, blocked. (0,0)=1<2, can flow there but already Pacific. So (0,1) alone cannot reach Atlantic directly but via DFS from Atlantic: (1,1)=3 can reach (0,1)=2 (going up, 2<=3). So (0,1) reaches both. (1,0)=4: Pacific border. Atlantic? Can flow to (1,1)=3<4 yes. (1,1): both borders. (0,0)=1: Pacific border, can it reach Atlantic? From (0,0): flows to nowhere higher. Atlantic DFS from border cannot reach (0,0) since (1,0)=4>(0,0)=1 no wait reverse DFS: from (1,0)=4, can we reach (0,0)=1? Need heights[0][0]>=heights[1][0] which is 1>=4 false. So (0,0) only Pacific.",

  "description": "There is an m x n rectangular island that borders both the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean touches the island's left and top edges, and the Atlantic Ocean touches the island's right and bottom edges.\n\nThe island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given an m x n integer matrix `heights` where `heights[r][c]` represents the height above sea level of the cell at coordinate (r, c).\n\nRain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height is less than or equal to the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.\n\nReturn a 2D list of grid coordinates `result` where `result[i] = [ri, ci]` denotes that rain water can flow from cell `(ri, ci)` to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.\n\nSee the full problem on [LeetCode 417](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/).",
