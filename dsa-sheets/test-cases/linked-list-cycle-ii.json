  "description": "Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null. A cycle exists if a node's next pointer points back to a previous node. Uses Floyd's cycle detection algorithm: after fast and slow pointers meet, move one pointer to head; they meet at the cycle start.",
