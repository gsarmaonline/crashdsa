  "description": "You are given an m x n binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n\nReturn the maximum area of an island in `grid`. If there is no island, return 0.\n\nSee the full problem on [LeetCode 695](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/).",
