  "description": "Solve the **Min Cost to Connect All Points** problem.\n\nGiven an array of points, find the minimum cost to connect all points. The cost to connect two points is the Manhattan distance between them: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. This is equivalent to finding the Minimum Spanning Tree.\n\nSee the full problem description on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/).",
